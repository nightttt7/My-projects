The projects I completed, including working projects, learning projects.


1. VBA project

2. MSFinance project
    - I completed those projects at MSFinance. Those projects are my main work in this company as I mentioned at WORK EXPERENCE. Most of them are in R-language, and some are SQL queries. All the real data has been deleted. Also, some important names have been changed. And here are all of them.
    - representative one: [new credit scoring](https://github.com/nightttt7/My-projects/blob/master/MSFinance%20project/new%20credit%20scoring%20model/step2/Model-score-screening_3_function_2.R)
