# My-projects
The projects I completed, including working projects, learning projects.


1. VBA project
    - I wrote some code in VBA-Excel when I work at TaoMicro Investment. They are pretty useful for me and my colleagues. And here are some of them.
2. MSFinance project
    - I completed those projects at MSFinance. Those projects are my main work in this company as I mentioned at WORK EXPERENCE. Most of them are in R-language, and some are SQL queries. All the real data has been deleted. Also, some important names have been changed. And here are all of them.
3. <Python Machine Learning Blueprints>
    - My codes (in jupyter notebook) when learning this book
