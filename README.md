### The projects I completed, including working projects, learning projects.

1. VBA project
    - I wrote some code in VBA-Excel when I work at TaoMicro Investment. They are pretty useful for me and my colleagues.
    - For example: [Simple Portfolio Choice](https://github.com/nightttt7/My-projects/blob/master/VBA%20project/Simple%20Portfolio%20Choice%20-%20VBA%20code%20in%20Excel.txt)
2. MSFinance project
    - I completed those projects at MSFinance. Those projects are my main work in this company. Most of them are in R-language, and some are SQL queries. All the real data has been deleted. Also, some important names have been changed.
    - For example: [new credit scoring](https://github.com/nightttt7/My-projects/blob/master/MSFinance%20project/new%20credit%20scoring%20model/step2/Model-score-screening_3_function_2.R)
